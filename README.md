# My Portfolio Website
Welcome to my portfolio website repository. If you are reading this, then you are most likely taking a look around this repository and viewing some of my work. I would first, like to appreciate you taking the time to look around my portfolio website repo. Secondly, I would like to suggest, if you haven't already, taking a look at the working portfolio website I have created.

## About the Developer
My name is Wesley, but I prefer to go by "Chef" around the internet. It honestly was just the first internet handle that came to my mind, cause I am a professional chef, and it stuck. It's pretty much what everyone calls me. I have been fascinated with programming since the early 2000's. I remember when the Super Nintendo was a huge deal in my house. I grew up around technology and video games, but fell in love with cooking. After a 12 year career and needing hobbies, I found myself needing to learn how to code in order to create things like a catering website or Dungeons & Dragons tools for my friends. Then it just kind of became a thing where I really enjoy doing this and I started to really study how programming works and learning how to get better at it.
